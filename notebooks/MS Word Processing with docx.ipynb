      "Introduction\n",
      "This report describes how the Plains qualitative risk results, generated as part of its pipeline integrity management risk algorithm, have been converted to semi-quantitative, risk results and mapped to the Plains Operational Risk Management Matrix (ORM).  This report also provides considerations for Plains for improved assessment and risk mitigation for certain pipelines or pipeline segments. \n",
      "The scope of the Plains Pipeline System that is addressed in this assessment includes approximately 7091 km of pipelines comprised of 25 pipeline systems [including but not limited to the following major systems: Manito (Saskatchewan), the Rainbow system (Alberta), South Saskatchewan (Saskatchewan), the Rangeland system (Alberta), and the Cochrane to Edmonton (Co-Ed) NGL system (Alberta)]. These pipeline systems transport crude oil, condensate (diluent), natural gas and natural gas liquids.\n",
      "The 25 pipeline systems are comprised of 326 pipelines.  From these pipelines, the processing of the data produced 106,961 dynamic segments where each dynamic segment is established based upon any change to the input variables between adjacent pipe sections.  \n",
      "This risk assessment report presents the system-wide risk results and provides an overview of the risk distribution as a function of percentage of the pipeline system at various risk levels.  The current “reportable” thresholds for the Plains ORM have been established as the upper right 4 x 3 (Likelihood x Consequence) portion of the risk matrix.  In particular, this report focuses on identifying those pipelines or pipelines with segments falling into these “reportable” portions of the matrix.\n",
      "\n",
      "Objective\n",
      "The objectives of this report were to:\n",
      "Quantitative results driver analysis from 2019 dataset\n",
      "High level comparison between quantitative results translated to ORM, and qualitative results translated to ORM, using 2019 dataset\n",
      "Approach\n",
      "The 2018 Plains risk assessment program evaluated the most recent available data and produced results for the likelihood, consequences, and total risk using the 2017 Plains Risk Algorithm Document (RAD) (version dated May 30, 2017) and Plains risk results from RiskAnalyst results run ID 580.  These Plains relative risk assessment results (qualitative risk) have been mapped to the Plains ORM through a semi-quantitative bench marking exercise (see Plains ORM and mapping process in Appendix A).  This process ensures that the results from the risk assessment can be compared to a defined risk acceptability criteria.\n",
      "Using the guidance of CSA Z662-15 Annex H and API 1160, threats to liquids pipelines can be classified in terms of “Time Dependent”, “Stable” and “Time Independent” categories.  An overview of the threat categories and specific threats considered in the assessment is outlined below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time Dependent Threats include:\n",
      "External Corrosion;\n",
      "Internal Corrosion; and,\n",
      "Stress Corrosion Cracking;\n",
      "\n",
      "Stable Threats include:\n",
      "Manufacturing Defects;\n",
      "Construction Threat; and,\n",
      "Equipment Failure;\n",
      "\n",
      "Time Independent Threats include:\n",
      "Third Party / Mechanical Damage;\n",
      "Incorrect Operations; and,\n",
      "Weather and Outside Force (Geotechnical and Hydrotechnical, Natural Force) \n",
      "The Plains Risk Algorithm document considers three scenarios of a potential consequence:\n",
      "Safety Consequence;\n",
      "Environmental Consequence; and,\n",
      "Economic Loss\n",
      "While the detailed, mapped risk results are retained and are viewable within a separate Excel file, this report presents a summary of the findings and provides an analysis of those pipelines or pipeline segments falling into the “reportable” portions of the Plains ORM. The reportable portion of the Plains ORM is defined as either:\n",
      "Very High Risk\n",
      "High Risk\n",
      "Medium Risk\n",
      "“Remote” Likelihood with “Problematic” or “Critical” Consequences\n",
      "“Occasional” Likelihood with “Problematic” Consequences \n",
      "A visual representation of the reportable portion of the Plains ORM is shown in Figure 1.\n",
      "For these pipelines, the RiskAnalyst application is utilized to conduct an analysis of driving factors within the likelihood and consequence scoring in order to aid in establishing appropriate risk reduction actions.\n",

      "Conversion of quantitative results to PMC ORM for risk algorithm comparison\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Threat Driver Analysis\n",
      "An assessment of overall risk can be presented in a number of different ways, recognizing that the presentation of results is often dictated by the objective for performing the analysis.  Within this presentation of the results, the overall risk considers the risk for each of the 326 pipelines and also considers the risk associated with dynamic segments along each pipeline. \n",
      "As described in Section 3, the current “reportable” thresholds for the Plains ORM have been established as the upper right 4 x 3 (Likelihood x Consequence) portion of the risk matrix.  In particular, this report focuses on identifying those pipelines or pipelines with segments falling into these “reportable” portions of the Plains ORM. \n",
      "Ten pipelines have enough “Medium” risk segments to render the pipeline as reportable at the pipeline level.  Three pipelines have “High” risk segments, while 24 pipelines have “Reportable Medium” risk segments.\n",

      "\n",
      "Figure 2 – Pipeline Risk Ranking Length Distribution – Safety Risk\n",
      "The risk ranking distribution in Figure xxx above shows that most of the pipeline segments are in the LOW RISK category, with only 25 km ranked as VERY HIGH RISK, and 154 km as HIGH RISK.

      "Where crack in-line inspection data such as USCD or EMAT does not exist, but any metal loss detection in-line inspection data such as of MFL, TFL, AFD, or UTWT survey data exist, likelihood of failure will be inferred by applying the Method 2 methodology to any metal loss imperfection detected using the latest survey among these technologies instead of crack imperfections. The objective of Method 1b is to conduct a conservative assessment to pipelines without a suitable crack ILI survey (or pipelines where a crack ILI technology is not yet available), by assuming any metal loss detected is a potential crack (also addressed as an inferred crack), and highlight areas of potential susceptibility to SCC. The resulting POE of inferred cracks will be multiplied by a susceptibility factor to screen sections having data attributes that don’t indicate a susceptibility to SCC.\n",

      "As indicated by ASME B31.8S, some construction and joining practices contribute to failure.  In particular, the presence of wrinkle bends, some buried couplings (such as Dresser couplings), buried threaded connections, and factors leading to suspect welds are of concern.\n",
      "The Construction Threat Algorithm covers five primary construction threat categories: welding-related threats; threats related to buried couplings; threats related to the presence of wrinkle bends; repair type threats; and, non-metallics threats.  For each of the above threat categories a pipeline segment is assessed from the perspective of potential susceptibility to the threat, and any contributing or mitigating factors are then taken into consideration.  Finally, as imperfections associated with construction threats are considered to be stable, the overall susceptibility to failure for construction threats is a function of the potential for external forces to be imposed.  Therefore, a Ground Movement Factor is included in the calculation of Construction Threat scores.\n",

The length of pipe across all systems in the reportable high and medium risk section has also increased from 0.3% (22 km) to 4.8% (350 km).

      "Outflow Modeling\n",
      "The potential impact of a loss of containment is a major driving factor for the overall risk associated with the operation of liquids pipelines. The process of assessing such an impact requires a conservative and useful prediction of the amount of product that may be lost in the event of a failure.\n",
      "Outflow modelling is the process by which these predictions are made. By interpreting the operational parameters into appropriate hydraulic considerations, a leak and resulting spill can be modeled at points along the centerline. The results of these simulations are combined to form a profile for the entire pipeline showing areas of higher and lower potential outflow.\n",
      "The amount of product released during a leak is ultimately dependent on the local hydraulic pressure at the leak site over the duration of the shutdown procedure along with the geometry of the pipeline as it contributes to the drainage of the pipeline. The conditions affecting the outflow of product during a leak occur in four distinct phases.\n",

      "Outflow Phases\n",
      "Phase 1 – Full Operation\n",
      "In the event of a leak, there is opportunity for some time to pass before the shutdown of the pipeline begins. At this time the pumps are in full operation and the leak flows at a constant rate for the full duration.\n",
      "The amount of product lost during Phase 1 is calculated by determining the instantaneous leak rate at the leak site and multiplying by the duration of the entire phase.\n",
      "The duration of the first phase is comprised of two periods, the detection period and the troubleshooting period. The former is the amount of time required to detect that a leak has occurred and the latter is the amount of time required by operations staff to ensure that a leak is occurring and action is required.\n",
      "Detection Period\n",
      "The time required to detect a leak is dependent on the size of the leak. This model considers a leak to be detected in one of three ways,\n",
      "An Instantaneous Drop in Pressure\n",
      "The Accumulation of Lost Product\n",
      "Detection on the Right-of-Way\n",
      "If an instantaneous pressure drop is sufficient, the result is the immediate detection of a leak. If the leak is too small to be noticed immediately then the leak is detected when the amount of lost product reaches a defined threshold. The leak detection time is capped by the maximum amount of time that could pass before a leak would be noticed by regular above-ground activities on the Right-of-Way.\n",
      "Troubleshooting Period\n",
      "The amount of time required by operations staff before initiating a shutdown is determined by the operator.\n",
      "Phase 2 – Pump Shutdown\n",
      "This phase begins after detecting a leak and initiating the shutdown of the pipeline. The calculations in this phase are conducted at time intervals over the duration of the pump shutdown phase.\n",
      "Discrete values for the pump pressure and flow rate of the pipeline over time form a shutdown profile. At each time interval the value of flow rate and pressure at the pump station is interpolated and used to determine the local pressure at the leak site and consequently the leak rate. \n",
      "Phase 3 – Valve Closure\n",
      "In this phase, the pumps have shut off and the product flows under the force of gravity alone. As the valves close during this phase the flow rate is restricted.\n"

      "Similar to Phase 2, the third phase calculates the local pressure at the leak site at discrete time intervals. The aperture is interpolated from the valve closure profile associated with each valve and consequently the flow coefficient is determined from the aperture.\n",
      " \n",
      "\n",
      "Phase 4 – Gravity Drainage\n",
      "After all valves are closed, the bulk flow of product is stopped.  However, the section contained by the closed valves can drain by gravity through the orifice. This phase is modeled statically and it is assumed that all product that can drain in this manner indeed does.\n",
      "When product is drained in this way it can be replaced either by air or by a vacuum. The pressure of the atmosphere can uphold a column of product before a vacuum is formed. The elevation of product upheld from atmospheric pressure is known as the column height. \n",
      "Drainage of any particular segment will be expected to continue until a significant local maximum is reached. It is important to consider the difference between minima and maxima when determining if a maximum is significant. If the difference between a local maximum and an adjacent local minimum is less than the internal diameter of the pipeline, then product drainage may continue until the next local maximum. \n",
      "Figure 9 shows the effect of the relation between the elevation changes and the inner diameter of the pipeline, where Case A forms a seal in the line where drainage cannot pass the low point. In Case B, the elevation differential is not sufficient to prevent further drainage.\n",
